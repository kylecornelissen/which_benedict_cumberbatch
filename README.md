# Which Benedict Cumberbatch?
Which Benedict Cumberbatch is a Front End Module 1 Project at Turing School of Software & Design that focuses on building out a two-player game based on comprehensive layouts and the classic game Concentration/Memory. Each player takes turn flipping over two cards at a time. If they match, that player “scores”. If the two cards don’t match, they must be flipped back over. The goal is the get the greatest amount of matches. It is a multi-page site to practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, precise CSS, as well as user interaction with JavaScript and the DOM.
